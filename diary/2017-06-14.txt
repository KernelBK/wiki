
icron 烧写

Thank you for your support. 
Now, a pair of our boards have been transmitting video. 
At the same time, we have started the next plan that make NT2000 design in some change to meet our needs.
I would like to make the following changes,
1. SiI9777 package size is too large, is RX and TX can be replaced by an independent transceiver?
2. In "hardware design guide", you mentioned the "king" deisgn.  I think AQLX107 can reduce power consumption, and will have more options for shell design. Can we get this design?
 





9777 are smaller packages available?



Further more, I want to know how to initialize the ICRON_ITC2053A-CB flash chip.
I got a guide from Shawn, but that is for ICRON RG2300, a USB SO-DIMM . Are they the same process?
I have asked ICRON about firmware and their response is not as fast as yours.
Can I copy the configuration ICRON of IC to our board?


今年初，我采购了20片ICRON_ITC2053A芯片，用于aptovision方案的项目。 在使用过程中发现，ICRON_ITC2053A需要从flash中加载固件，aptovision说需要从你这边拿到固件，你能否提供固件和烧写方法给我？ 


Earlier this year, I purchased 20 pieces of ICRON_ITC2053A chips for the aptovision project. In use, ICRON_ITC2053A need to load firmware from flash, and aptovision said I can get firmware from your side. Can you provide firmware and programming methods to me?

去掉7-seg，采用总线替代。
