我知道MAC地址的规则，我一般不会修改高位数据。 
所以确认了mac地址是没有问题的。 
我有20块板，我一次生成了所有设备的mac地址，附件中你可以看到。

Thank you for let me know the rule of MAC address, and I also don't modify the first three bytes. 
So there's no problem with the MAC address.
I have 20PCS of boards, and I have generated the MAC addresses for all devices at once, as you can see in the attachment.

我们的市场部遇到一个案子，需要将一个PC的4个HDMI视频输出到远程的4个显示器，好像输出的内容中有3D的内容，因此需要传输以后的视频要做到非常严格的同步。我想知道在P2P的应用中，两个不同P2P的连接中延迟有多大？ 是否能够完全做到行场同步？ 

P2P中TX和RX之间的延迟是多少？ 他们是固定值吗？两个P2P连接能否做到行场同步？

Our marketing department have a case, that 4 HDMI video output of a PC to 4 remote display, may have 3D the contents to the output, so they want the 4 transmitted video has very strict synchronization. 
So I'd like to know some of the NT2000 performance parameters.
What is the delay between TX and RX in P2P?  Are they fixed value? 
Can the two P2P connections achieved vsync and hsync synchronization?

How much delay in two different P2P connections in P2P applications Can you do full field synchronization?
