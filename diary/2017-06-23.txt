
我想我高估了我们的进度，之前由于没有散热设备，因此没有完整测试自己的板子。 
今天的测试中，我发现我们的板无法输出计算机的HDMI视频。
我试过DEMO是可以的。 
树莓派也是可以的，因为树莓派被我设置忽略EDID
我想问题一定是出在EDID上，我可以从RX读到显示器的EDID。也保存了一个EDID到TX。

请问我如何做进一步的调试？

I think I overestimated our progress, because there was no heat sink, so I didn't test my board completely.
In today's test, I found out that our boards couldn't output computer HDMI video.
I've tried DEMO, and that's fine.
Using Raspberry pi as video source is ok, because raspberry pi is setted to ignore reading EDID.
So I think the problem must be on the EDID. I can read the EDID of the monitor from RX, And the EDID to TX is also saved to device.
Sometimes GUI can show the resolution in tile, sometimes the resolution value is zero. 
How can I do further debugging?
