两个p2p之间的延迟能不能小于1帧？
或者说，P2P的延迟抖动时间能否小于一帧？ 

Can the delay between the two P2P be less than 1 frames?
In other words, is the delay jitter or skew time of P2P less than one frame?

I want to know the definition of zero-frame latency? 
What does "zero-frame latency" mean?

Thank you for reminding me of this.
Back to our case, you said the TX and RX delay is not a fix value, do you know the max value of the uncertain time? 
In 4k, 3840x2160x60p, the time of 2 line is 1/60/2160=7.7us. 
If the uncertain time less then 7.7us, I think the performance meets the application.

汪总，
营销中心测试方案是怎么样的，计划采用多少屏幕、收发设备、信号源，是否需要支持HDCP。 
我这边有4个新采购的小米盒子3s, 支持4k(3840x2160x60p), 和一台sony 4k蓝光播放器， NT2000有3对。 

测试是否需要HDCP


169.254.1.1

我的设备
=======
我想我高估了我们的进度，之前由于没有散热设备，因此没有完整测试自己的板子。 
今天的测试中，我发现我们的板无法输出计算机的HDMI视频。
我试过DEMO是可以的。 
树莓派也是可以的，因为树莓派被我设置忽略EDID
我想问题一定是出在EDID上，我可以从RX读到显示器的EDID。也保存了一个EDID到TX。

请问我如何做进一步的调试？

I think I overestimated our progress, because there was no heat sink, so I didn't test my board completely.
In today's test, I found out that our boards couldn't output computer HDMI video.
I've tried DEMO, and that's fine.
Using Raspberry pi as video source is ok, because raspberry pi is setted to ignore reading EDID.
So I think the problem must be on the EDID. I can read the EDID of the monitor from RX, And the EDID to TX is also saved to device.
Sometimes GUI can show the resolution in tile, sometimes the resolution value is zero. 
How can I do further debugging?
