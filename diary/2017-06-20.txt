如何测试得出我们比别人好的结论。 



It’s OK to upgrade firmware without using ExpressLink tool. There are two binary files. One is FalshWriterGoldenearsASIC.bin, and the other is FirwareGoldenearsASIC.bin.
 
Here are the steps to perform upgrade:
 
1. Connect the serial port using the settings specified in the previous section.
2. Pull the C23_BOOT_SEL0 pin low.
3. Reset by pulsing the PROG_B pin low or power-cycle the board.
4. Wait until the Bootloader start up string is received on the serial port.
It should look like: "Goldenears XX.XX.XX Bootloader version XX.XX" “Lex PlatformID ddd" or “Rex PlatformID ddd"
5. The module will now transmit a NAK character (hex: 0x15) to initiate the transfer of the firmware image.
6. Transmit FlashWriterGoldenearsASIC.bin over the serial port using the XMODEM protocol.
7. Wait for the module to print the message "Serial Flash Erase Complete" to the serial port. This indicates that the flash is now erased and ready for programming. 
8. The module will now transmit a NAK character (Hex: 0x15) to initiate the transfer of the firmware image.
9. Transmit either the firmware image FirwareGoldenearsASIC.bin over the serial port using the XMODEM protocol.
10. Pull the C23_BOOT_SEL0 pin high.
11. To reset the module, either PROG_B can be asserted or a CR/LF can be transmitted over the UART to the board.
