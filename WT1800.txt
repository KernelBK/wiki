167 For example, the efficiency cannot be computed correctly if elements or wiring units used in the computation have different power units, such as W (watt) and J (joule).
168 Correct measured values may not be obtained immediately after the PLL source or its frequency changes, because the PLL circuit inside the WT1800 redetects the frequency.
