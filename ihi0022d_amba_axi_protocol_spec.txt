282 Coherent Data accesses from a set of observers to a memory location are coherent accesses to that memory location by the members of the set of observers are consistent with there being a single total order of all writes to that memory location by all members of the set of observers.
266 For non-cacheable transactions a monitor, which is remote from the master issuing an Exclusive access, is used to track all access to a location that is being monitored for exclusivity and this monitor can return a pass or fail response as part of the write response.
219 If the snooped master is likely to be the next master to store to the cache line, then this specification recommends that the cache line remains Dirty in the snooped cache but is passed as Clean to the initiating master.
205 These combinations can be used when a memory location can be cached at a domain level that requires snooping, but the transaction is deliberately not cached downstream, for example, in a system level cache.
198 Whether the store results in the master issuing a read or write transaction depends on whether the accessed cache line is held in the local cache, and if it is in the local cache, the state it is in.
192 Some synchronization barriers also have a requirement that all transactions issued before the barrier transaction must have reached the destination slave component before the barrier completes.
368 For example, if a processor instruction performing a cache maintenance operation on a location with Device memory attributes is required to operate on all caches within the system then, the master must issue a cache maintenance transaction as Outer Shareable, since this is the most pervasive of the cache maintenance operations and operates on all the required caches.
