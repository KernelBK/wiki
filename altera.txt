279 Altera recommends that you start SSN analysis early in the design cycle to obtain preliminary results and make adjustments to your I/O assignments, and iterate through the design cycle to finally perform a fully constrained SSN analysis with complete information about your board. 
276 It also provides device-specific coding recommendations for registers and certain logic functions such as tri-state signals, multiplexers, and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) functions, and includes references to other Altera documentation for low-level logic design information.
267 You can easily enter into a reset asynchronously, but releasing a reset asynchronously can lead to potential problems (also referred to as “reset removal”) with metastability, including the hazards of unwanted situations with synchronous circuits involving feedback.
158 External revision control supports design file version experimentation through branching and merging different versions of source code from multiple designers.
