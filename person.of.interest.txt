
bug£º the machine only social security number in New York.

You are being watched.
The government has a secret system.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but, it sees everything.
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
People like you.
Crimes that the government considered irrelevant.
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
But I needed a partner.
Someone with the skills to intervene.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You'll never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
