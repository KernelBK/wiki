
Scales streaming video up or down in resolution. Bilinear and nearest neighbor
modes are supported.

Run-time adjustment of input and output resolution, scaling factors, and scale
type. 

Very slight numerical errors (+0/-2 LSb) in output data due to coefficient arithmetic.
Impossible to notice without adjustment in video levels. Attempted to fix by setting
coeff11 to 1.0 - other coefficients, but this caused timing issues.
