
314 For example, a global replacement policy using the FIFO algorithm would locate the page that has been in memory the longest and would free it to satisfy a page fault; a local replacement policy would limit its search for the oldest page to the set of pages already owned by the process that incurred the page fault.
303 Unlike normal thread context switches, transitions between paired threads via fast LPC don¡¯t cause a rescheduling event in the kernl, thereby enabling the server thread to run for the remaining time slice of the client thread before having to take its turn in the kernel¡¯s preemptive thread scheduler.
278 System administrators can benefit from this information as well, because understanding how the operating system works ¡°under the coers¡± facilitates understanding the performance behavior of the system and makes troubleshooting system problems much easier when thingsgo wrong.
266 The scheduling algorithms are enhanced to make optimal use of multiprocessor hyperthreaded machines, such as by scheduling threads on an idle physical processor versus choosing an idle logical processor on a physical processor whose other logical processors are busy.
261 Whether you are new to Windows internals or an old hand at kernel development, you will find lots of detailed analysis and examples to help improve your understanding of the core mechanisms of Windows as well as the general principles of operating system design.
331 In the case of service-hosting processes (a process that contains more than one service), the process¡¯s token will contain the servce SIDs of all services that are part of the service group associated with the process, including services that are not started because there is no way to add new SIDs after a token has been created.
325 As part of the many enhancements to the interrupt mechanisms in the kernel and HAL, Windows Vista introduced a new API, IoConnectInterruptEx, that added support for more advanced types of interrupts (called message-based interrupts) and enhanced the current support for standard interrupts (also called line-based interrupts).
318 For example, if Group Policy allows you to log on to your laptop even when you¡¯re not connected to a domain, then your domain credetial verifiers are cached in the registry, so an attacker could use tools to obtain your domain account password hash and use that to try to obtain your password with a password cracker.
