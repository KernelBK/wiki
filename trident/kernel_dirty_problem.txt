A working tree is said to be "dirty" if it contains modifications which have not been
committed to the current branch. 
So, to me that means you started with a particular branch of the kernel (or some part of it) 
and then made some modifications to some code in there, but did not commit those changes 
to the branch. The result is that the build (or some part of it) is tagged as "dirty".
